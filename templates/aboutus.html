<h2 style="font-family:  monaco, Consolas, 'Lucida Console', monospace;"> Who are we? </h2>

<p style="width: 70%;"> We are a group of students at Babson College, learning Python through 
Problem Solving & Software Design class. We created this website for the purpose of 
providing a simple and straighforward website that can provide sentiment analysis for any 
keyword users puts in! Sentiment analysis is a process of analyzing the emotional tone behind the series of words. 
Through sentiment analysis, users can identify if the keyword is positive, neutral, or negative. 
Moreover, it is one of the most commonly used tools for analyzing opinions about a specific topic. 
We wanted to create an accessible and easy-to-use website that does the hard work for numerous companies that conduct sentiment analysis. 
Rather than having to create a whole programming application to conduct sentiment analysis, 
users can simply go on our website to get sentiment-related information about any topics. 
</p>

<h2 style="font-family:  monaco, Consolas, 'Lucida Console', monospace;"> How does our analysis work? </h2>

<p style="width: 70%;"> Sentiment analysis of the keywords users put in would be sentiments based on the tweets posted 
on Twitter server. Since Twitter is one of the most popular social media platforms, nowadays, we believe that 
our analysis would provide a holistic and comprehensive view of the overall sentiment of the 
public. Through our website, users would get three specific analyses, which includes polaritiy, subjectivity, and 
overall sentiment.
